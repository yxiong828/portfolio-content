            <!--chinese dumplings recipe-->
            In China, when we talk about dumplings, we’re usually referring to boiled 
                dumplings (or shui jiao, 水饺). Not potstickers, not steamed dumplings, but 
                boiled ones. We consider it a staple, a delicious alternative to rice and noodles. 
                You might think boiled dumplings are not as tasty as potstickers. After all, 
                potstickers have a nicely charred surface and crispy texture and look great, right? 
                But to us, boiled dumplings are the ultimate comfort food that we eat every week. 
                They’re super delicious if you make them the right way.

            Boiled dumplings are moist and juicy. With a small bite of a dumpling, the hot and flavorful soup 
                will drizzle from the filling.  If you’ve ever tried Shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao, 小笼包), 
                you know what I’m talking about. The handmade dumpling wrappers are thin, tender, and delicious. The 
                filling is well balanced with meat and vegetable, not too greasy, nice in flavor, and comforting. 
                Everything works perfectly together to create a fulfilling, healthy, and hearty one-dish meal.
