        <h2>About the website</h2>

		<p>
			       A recipe is full of quantities, measurements, and instructions, but it is not just a formula. 
            Often, it is a memory—of that week you were in Florence, or of your mom baking cookies, or of 
            your homeland across the world. Which is to say: Often, it is personal. Discover original recipes curated by world-class chefs for a variety of cuisines, including
            Chinese Dumplings, French Mushroom Pie, Japanese Sushi, Indian Fried Rice, Taiwan Pork Rice, 
            Spanish Paella, Thai Curry Bowl, Korean Bibimbap, German Suassage with Sauerkraut...
